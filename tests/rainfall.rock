Doesn't seem to work fully because of lack of integer parsing)

My hopes are nothing
The future is nothing without my hopes

Listen to the sky
A nightmare is "99999" (Want 'decimated, destroyed; sparkling, sinuously perfected' but that's a number and we can't parse listen)
Until the sky is a nightmare
Build my hopes up
My dreams are the sky with the future
They are my dreams
Listen to the sky

If my hopes ain't nothing
shout the future over my hopes

If my hopes are nothing
whisper the future of my hopes
